# UE4_WeaponSystem
The UE4 WeaponSystem Plugin provides you with many base classes and features to quickly and easily creating and implementing your own weapon system for your Unreal Engine Game


## Description
The "Weapon System Base" provides you with some very basic and useful classes and features to create your own Weapon System for a UE4 game. You'll find base classes for WeaponTypes, Weapons, Projectiles as well as hitable character and actor base classes, a floatable healthbar and also a dissolving material that you can use to destroy an actor on death. Just derive from the base classes and adjust the settings like Damage-Factor, Projectile-Speed, Ammo Count in inventory, Ammo Count in Clip, Clip Size, Firing Sound, Impact Sound, Impact Particle Effect, etc ... I strongly recommend you to download the sample project at "" to see how the Weapon System works and is implemented in a real game project.

## Notes
This UE Weapon System Base Plugin is created, released and maintained by Kim David Hauser with the intent of making it easier for beginners and advanced UE Devs to start creating a Weapon System for their UE Game Projects. The Plugin is of course by far not 100% what you have in your mind for setting up your own game, but it can be used as a powerfull start library - and with a little bit of amendment here and there you should be able really quick setting up your own Weapon System. 
What I manly did for this project was consolidating the most important stuff that I need every time over and over again when I start creating a new 1st / 3rd person shooter or similar. Please also check out my other projects.
